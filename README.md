# La-Morena
A Foundation Language Model for Multilayer Regulation of RNA

This repository contains code and pre-trained weights for RNA foundation language model **La Morena**. La Morena outperformed benchmark models in various RNA regulation tasks, helping deciphering the regulation rules of RNA.  
La Morena was developed by Rnasys Lab and Bio-Med Big Data Center, Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health (SINH), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
